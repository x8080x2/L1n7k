Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: nginx). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: www.chatterdrive.info
  Type:   dns
  Detail: DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up A for www.chatterdrive.info - check that a DNS record exists for this domain; DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up AAAA for www.chatterdrive.info - check that a DNS record exists for this domain

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to verify the temporary nginx configuration changes made by Certbot. Ensure the listed domains point to this nginx server and that it is accessible from the internet.

Some challenges have failed.
Ask for help or search for solutions at https://community.letsencrypt.org. See the logfile /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log or re-run Certbot with -v for more details.
