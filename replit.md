# Outlook Login Automation

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive web browser automation tool specifically designed for Microsoft Outlook login processes. It leverages Puppeteer (a headless Chrome Node.js API) to programmatically navigate to Outlook's web interface, perform automated login operations, and extract session cookies for authentication persistence. The system is configured to run in Replit's environment with appropriate browser settings and security considerations for cloud-based execution.

**Important Note**: This tool is designed for legitimate automation purposes such as testing, development, and authorized account management. Users must comply with Microsoft's Terms of Service and only use this on accounts they own or have explicit permission to access.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
